earthquake-list-widget
======================

A javascript package for displaying recent earthquake information on a webpage.

Getting Started
---------------

To embed an earthquake list widget on your webpage, download and build the
distributable code from this respository. Once you have built the
```dist/earthquake-list-widget.js``` and ```dist/earthquake-list-widget.css```
files, place them on your web server at an HTTP addressable URL. These files
should be placed next to each other (in the same directory) on the web server.

Next, add a container element to your HTML page where you would like to embed
the widget.
```html
...
<div id="list-widget-container"></div>
...
```

Now include the ```earthquake-list-widget.js``` script on your page. Be sure
you correctly reference the path to where you placed the script on your server.
```html
...
<script src="path-to-js/earthquake-list-widget.js"></script>
...
```

Finally, write a tiny bit of Javascript in order to put the widget into your
page:
```html
<script>
var EqList = require('listwidget/EqList');
EqList({
  container: document.querySelector('#list-widget-container'),
  feed: EqList.SIG_URL_MONTH
});
</script>
```

The [examples directory](example) contains additional usage examples.

Custom Lists
------------

A list can be customized in several ways.

First, you can provide a different URL for the ```feed``` parameter to the
constructor. Any URL specified must return data in the
[USGS GeoJSON feed format](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

If a predefined feed does not provide the exact sub-set of earthquake data, it
is recommended one use the smallest feed that is a superset of the desired
earthquakes, then provide a custom ```includeEvent``` method as an optional
parameter to the constructor.

Sort order is also customizable by providing the ```compareEvents``` method as
an additional optional parameter to the constructor. The ```compareEvents```
function should conform to the
[```Array.sort([compareFunction])```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort)
definition.

One may also customize the list output format by extending the EqList class.
The EqList class provides several extension points for customization. At the
highest level, one can override the ```getEventMarkup``` method (see source
code for details).

If only minor changes are desired, one can override a sub-method (again, see
source code for details):

- ```getEventValue```
- ```getEventTitle```
- ```getEventSubtitle```
- ```getEventAside```

Also, when sub-classing the EqList class, one may also create custom
```includeEvent``` and ```compareEvents``` methods if so desired.
